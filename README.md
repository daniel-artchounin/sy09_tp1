# Project 1 of the course Data analysis and data mining (SY09)

In the context of the laboratories of the course Data analysis and data mining (SY09) taught at Université de Technologie de Compiègne (UTC), via R, we have applied various data mining methods in various situations, simulated or real world data sets. This repository contains the codebase of the first project of this course. It allowed us to use the following concepts: descriptive statistics and principal component analysis (PCA).
